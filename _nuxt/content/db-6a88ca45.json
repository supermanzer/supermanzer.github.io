Most of the time it was just little hobby projects but\nfor the past 3 years or so (as of first writing this) I've been building steadily more complex business applications using this framework. I find Python\na fun language to write software in and the Django framework does a good job of porting that fun to designing web applications. I really enjoy how well\nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts translate to designing data systems. Since one of the reasons I started coding was to solve business administration\nproblems (see [About Me](/about)), this felt like a natural evolution of my interests. However, as my applications have started to do more and more I have\nhad to learn some new techniques to solve the problems I want to solve while providing the performance I want to give my users.\n\n### My Problem\n\nFor the past few years, the applications I have been building have mostly been concerned with overcoming the inefficiencies of the ERP system my company uses.\nI'm not going to name names but it wasn't the greatest. Thankfully, it did use a fairly straightforward PostgreSQL back-end that I could connect to and execute\nqueries for things like inserting orders in large batches. Incidentally [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is my hands down favorite RDBMS and with the inclusion of a fully functional JSON Binary field type I think even NoSQL devotees can find plenty to love about it.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.acunetix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slow.png\" width=400>\n\nAnyway, the ERP back-end ran pretty dang slow like (1-5 seconds for a basic SELECT with ~10K records). My most used application processed reconciliation files\nfrom Amazon, turned them into aggregated orders (by state for tax purposes), and wrote the orders and lines into the ERP. Back when we first started the number\nof transactions were pretty minimal and processing was speedy but Amazon is kind of good at helping people buy stuff so our volume took off and my application got quite sluggish. Then I kept getting requests for additional functions to be built into the file processing and order writing functions. All of this was taking so long I had to adjust my request timeout values to tens of minutes just to keep my users from getting shown the \"Broken Server\" screen.\n\n### Celery to the Rescue\n\n![Celery In Django](https://en.proft.me/media/django/django_celery_architecture.png)\n\nI became aware of [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) when I started researching how to Docker-ize my Django apps. Most of the tutorials I found took me through not only creating services for my Proxy Server (NGINX), Database (PostgreSQL), and Web application (Django) but also involved using Celery + [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) (seriously, who names these things?) as well as using Redis for cache and session management. I figured it was better to have a more robust system than not so I went with it.\n\nFor those of you not familiar but curious I would highly encourage you to read the documentation linked above. However just to get everyone on the same page, Celery allows you to offload some of the computational work of an application to worker processes that process these tasks asynchronously while allowing your application to respond back the user in a timely manner. Apps write tasks (with signatures detailing inputs and such) to message broker(s) (RabbitMQ in this case) and a worker process grabs the task signature and gets to work. In addition to getting triggered via a user request, you can aslo schedule tasks using `beat-scheduler` in Celery. This has been a huge help to me running both high frequency API polling and also periodic maintenance functions in my applications.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learn-web-development/9781789953299/assets/857bb6b8-e872-410f-8a68-fd4e3ebb34ad.png\" width=500>\n\nIn fact, by installing a module called `django-beat-scheduler` I was able to create `crontab` like schedules for any task I wanted directly in the default Django admin interface. Anyone working across multiple development environments and version control will understand how much easier it makes your life to be able to do something like that without modifying any actual code.\n\nNow I was able to bundle up all the file processing actions into a task. When my application needed to perform these actions a task was pushed to the RabbitMQ broker and the ID of that task was returned back to my application. I even learned, through Celery's wonderful documentation, how to have my tasks update their status to indicate their progress for long running tasks (e.g. `{status: 'In Progress', processed: 17, total: 80}`). I wrote a nifty little Django view that returned task details when a valid task ID was included in the URL and wrote a simple Javascript to check task status every 20 seconds and update a progress bar and tooltip text with the info. I was feeling pretty dang cool!\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/products/Emoji_Icon_-_Sunglasses_cool_emoji.png?v=1485573433\" width=100>\n\n### The Exciting Part - Workflows\n\nWell then things got really interesting and that gets us to what I'm so excited about that I am spending a Sunday morning in my jammies writing in a markdown file. As part of a transition to new ERP, I was tasked with turning thousands of automatically generated purchase orders (along with Bill of Material records) into manufacturing schedules. These records were accessible only via a REST API and, unfortunately, the service providing this API was not always super stable. While outages usually only lasted a second, it was enough to train wreck the entire process (since I had written my tasks as long, involved functions). This made me reconsider my design and I found exactly what I needed in the Celery documentation on [Workflows](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/canvas.html), referred to in Celery as a Canvas API.\n\nI had known that a good task design is small and self contained, like a good function, but I didn't know how I would keep track of what remained to be processed and how I would ensure that all the records that needed to be related to each other were. That's when I realized what I could do with `groups` and `chains`. A `group` is a set of tasks that are processed in parallel.\n\n```python\n@app.task\ndef create_local_purchase_orders(data):\n  \"\"\"Execute PO generating tasks in parallel for all records in data\"\"\"\n  g = group(make_po(record) for record in data)\n  result = g()  # Default async result returned\n  return result\n```\n\nThis would work great for my purchase orders (which were independent of each other). For creating related records from the Bill of Materials data (product + compoonent records), the `chain` object was just what I was looking for. Using this feature you can create a series of tasks to be executed sequentially and even have the results returned from one task sent as an input into the following one. In fact, I could combine the `group` and `chain` approaches when processing my Bill of Material data.\n\n```python\n@app.task(bind=True, max_retries=5)\ndef fetch_bom(data)\n    try:\n        result = get_api_bom_data(data['product'])\n        return result\n    except Exception as exc:\n        raise self.retry(exc=exc, countdown=2) # Retry this API call after 2 second\n\n@app.task\ndef make_bom(data)\n    # Because the results of make_product will be returned to make_component, I use that\n    # approach to pass all necessary data to the make_component function, including the\n    # ID of the product record that was just created.\n    task_chain = chain(fetch_bom(data), make_product.s(), make_component.s())()\n\n@app.task\ndef group_boms(list_of_bom_data):\n  \"\"\"create product and component records for each bill of materials record\"\"\"\n\n  g_chainz = g(make_bom.s(data) for data in list_of_bom_data)()\n```\n\n#### How This Helps\n\nAs I mentioned at the start of this section, one of the main problems I ran into was the API would sometimes be unavailable for a second and that would train wreck the processing of hundreds of product records. Well, in addition to being able to radically simplify what was a single function definition that stretched over dozens of lines to three simple, mostly one-line functions, I was able to include a very easy to configure retry policy.\n\nTake a look at the first task function `fetch_bom`. This is calling another function (not defined) that encapsulates getting the correct URL, performing the authentication, making the HTTP request, and returning the data. The task is written such that, in the event of a failure, it will wait 2 seconds and then retry itself (while also keeping track of the exception that was triggered). I've also included a `max_retries` argument to prevent this task from going into an endless loop of pinging the API if it ever goes down for some serious reason.\n\n#### What About Database Validation?\n\nOh yeah! Well, once I got hip to all this grouping and chaining, my PostgreSQL back-end was having records INSERT'd and UPDATE'd faster than I've ever dealt with previously. What I quickly found out was that some of the validation rules I had written in Python weren't quick enough to catch records that violated those rules before they were written to the DB. At first this was frustrating and for a little while I went back to a more sequential approach. However, I did some more reading about [Django model definition](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/) and where to specify record constraints so that they were applied at the DB layer. In the process I wound up learning more about how to utilize the [Django database API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/) to move more of the record processing and annotation to the DB layer as well.\n\nAll in all, this has made my Django applications more robust, more performant, and provided an opportunity to better understand some of the layers of my tech stack I tend to just take for granted.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/celery-workflows","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1678741318718},"$loki":3},{"slug":"queryset-annotations","description":"Making reusable database queries and customizing server logic","title":"Using Django Queryset Annotations","tech":"Django","img":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/27804?s=400&v=4","published_to_twitter":false,"author":{"name":"Ryan Manzer","bio":"He puts the Manzer in Supermanzer","image":"/images/supermanzer.jpeg"},"tags":["django","tech","python"],"toc":[{"id":"situation","depth":2,"text":"Situation"},{"id":"differences-between-property-and-annotations","depth":2,"text":"Differences between @property and annotations"},{"id":"real-life-example","depth":2,"text":"Real Life Example"},{"id":"annotations-to-the-rescue","depth":2,"text":"Annotations to the Rescue!"},{"id":"reusability-counts","depth":2,"text":"Reusability Counts"},{"id":"one-more-example","depth":2,"text":"One More Example"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"situation"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#situation","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Situation"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As I've noted in other posts, I've been using the "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.djangoproject.com/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Django Framework"}]},{"type":"text","value":" to build custom applications for a while now.

Like probably most beginners who picked up the framework because of their love of the Python language, when I needed to associate some calculated value with my data model objects I reached for the `@property` decorator and used Python. It did not take long though before I ran into the limitations of such an approach. It is difficult to filter or order a queryset on a value that doesn't exist as far as the database is concerned. That's when I turned my attention to the `annotate()` function; one of the more advanced components of the [Django ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/querysets/#annotate).\n\n## Differences between `@property` and annotations\n\nThis may be obvious to most people who would choose to click on a post titled Using Django Queryset Annotations but there is a pretty big difference between calculating fields using a model function decorated with the `@property` decorator and a queryset annotation (if you need to brush up on what a decorator in Python is, I highly recommend [this post](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)). I am probably going to overlook some other important factors but, to me, the biggest difference between the two approaches in where the calculation happens.\n\nFirst let me back up and do a brief and likely inaccurate summary of how a Django model object functions. The model class corresponds to a table in some version of a relational database. An object (an instance of the class), at it's most basic, represents a row from that table. When you instantiate a model you perform a query on the database and use the data returned to build an object in Python. There's a bunch of other nifty goodies that Django has built into the framework that are a big help when interacting with the databases that power web applications and I would highly recommend anyone who is interested to read more in the wonderfully well written [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/).\n\nThat being said, the most basic difference between using a Django model method decorated as a property and a queryset annotation is that the former takes place _after_ the data has been retrieved from the database and the function is called on individual instances of the model class. The queryset annotation, on the other hand, converts the calculation into whatever variant of `SQL` is appropriate and has the database server performs the calculation and returns it as part of the object data.\n\n## Real Life Example\n\nLet's make this a bit more concrete and work with some model definitions. Here's a situation I ran into while building an application to keep track of product manufacturing. We are going to have three models in this example: the `FinishedProductRun` defines a manufacturing run of a specific retail product, the `BulkProductRun` defines a manufacturing run of the stuff that makes up the retail products, and a BillOfMaterials which describes what Bulk goes into what Finished Product at what quantity (think Tylenol: Bulk is the actual pills, Finished Product are the different sized bottles, Bill of Materials defines the stuff that makes the pills as well as how many pills per bottle).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n  my_app/models.py\n\"\"\"\nfrom django.db import models\n\n\nclass FinishedProductRun(models.Model):\n  date_created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)  # Automatically sets the value to the current date when record created\n  product_id = models.CharField(max_length=60) # Unique identifier for a specific finished product\n  quantity = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n  lot_number = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n  bulk = models.ForeignKey('BulkRun', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='finished_products')\n  bom = models.ForeignKey('BillOfMaterials', on_delete=models.SET_NULL)\n\n  # Django Models can be more than data, we can add methods too!\n  def __str__(self):\n    return f'{self.product_id} - {self.lot_number}'\n\nclass BulkProductRun(models.Model):\n  date_created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n  quantity = models.IntegerField(default=0)  # This is\n  product_id = mmodels.CharField(max_length=60)\n\nclass BillOfMaterials(mdoels.Model):\n  date_created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n  product_id = models.CharField(max_length=60)\n  product_name = models.CharField(max_length=120)\n  bottle_quantity = models.IntegerField(defualt=60)\n  bulk_product_id = models.CharField(max_length=60)\n```\n\nOkay so I've got my models and I'm displaying this information to my users. The manager of the manufacturing plant tells me he needs to see how much bulk product is being consumed for each finished product run. Well I feel like I know my way around a Django model so I go ahead and add a new function that I'll decorate as a property (defining a basic `getter` method).\n\n```python\n@property\ndef bulk_quantity(self):\n  return self.quantity * self.bom.bottle_quantity\n```\n\nIn this case we query the database for the details of a specific FinishedProductRun and then use that, along with the bottle quantity we get from the related BillOfMaterials record, to calculate the quantity of a given BulkRun used. All the values are loaded into Python and the calculation is performed when the `obj.bulk_quantity` attribute is accessed. This is a fairly simple and straightforward approach and works great when I'm displaying the details of a specific record to my users. The problem shows up when you get asked \"Okay now can we see that lists of records and sort on bulk quantity?\". In the Django framework both the data in the records and the order in which they are returned are determined in the database server. Django model querysets are also lazy and you don't actually query the database until you actually want to access the values. So doing something like `products_by_bulk = FinishedProductRun.objects.all().order_by('-bulk_quantity)` won't work because this will generate the SQL `ORDER BY bulk_available DESC` and we'll get a `FieldDoesNotExist` exception.\n\n## Annotations to the Rescue!\n\nNow here's where Django annotations REALLY shine. Just as one could write a custom SQL query to return the calculation directly in the database, we can do the same with the Django API. Here I use [F expressions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/expressions/#f-expressions), which are not as rude as they might sound. F expressions allow you to make references to the values of fields (or annotations) in the database. You can actually get some pretty cool efficiency optimization out of it as well! Let's take a look:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n  my_app/model_annotations.py\n\"\"\"\nfrom django.db.models import F, IntegerField\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Cast\n\n# Since both these fields are integers we don't NEED\n# to Cast them but I like to remain in the habit.  I haven't\n# noticed any negative impact on my query performance.\nbulk_quantity = Cast(\n  F('quantity') * F('bom__bulk_quantity'),\n  output_field=IntegerField()\n)\n\n```\n\nNow we can use it in a List View for our FinishedProductRun objects like so (if you're not hip to generic class based views, check them out [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/class-based-views/)):\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n  my_app/views.py\n\"\"\"\nfrom django.views.generic.list import ListView\n\nfrom my_app.models import FinishedProductRun\nfrom my_app.model_annotations import bulk_quantity\n\n\nclass FPRList(ListView):\n\n  model = FinishedProductRun\n\n\n  # Now let's put our nifty model annotation to work by overriding the default get_queryset method\n  def get_queryset(self):\n    qs = super().get_queryset()  # Start with the basic queryset, it won't hit the DB until we render the list\n    qs.annotate(\n      bulk_quantity=bulk_quantity  # Use our pre-defined calculation and tell the DB what to call it\n    ).order_by('-bulk_quantity') # And order the results by our new field\n\n    return qs  # <- Don't forget this part!\n```\n\n## Reusability Counts\n\nWell that was nifty but an astute reader might be asking \"Why bother with the `model_annotations.py` file when you could just write the calculation in the `get_queryset` method?\". Good question, I'm glad you asked!\n\nAs we can see from our models defined earlier, the FinishedProductRun is the only model to which this annotation can apply since it's the only one with the required fields. Now if we only had this one list view then it would seem perfectly reasonable\nto just define the the calculation directly in the `get_queryset` method. However...it has been my experience applications tend to keep expanding. What if you need a separate list view to return specific subsets of our model? What if we need to use the `bulk_quantity` annotation on the related `finished_products` set for a specific BulkProductRun? Sure it's not hard to copy and paste a few times but what if we need to rename one of the fields involved? You can see how this can become a tangled mess really quickly. This is why, shortly after beginning to use annotations (and creating some of the problems I just described), I took the approach of creating a `model_annotations.py` file where I store them. And, since there is nothing model specific about the annotations themselves, we could define annotations based on fields that exist on more than one model (`date_created` for example) and apply it when retrieving data from any of our models.\n\nAnyway, I have found Django queryset annotations to be something that makes me smile when seeking to provide more useful info for my end users so I thought I'd share.\n\n## One More Example\n\nOne of my projects is a Django powered web application to simulate a local library card catalog website. In this scenario I used Django's dynamic query annotations, bundled in some model `save()` methods, to set the value for a static field. This approach reduces query complexity when the value hasn't changed and also abstracts the decision making for the correct value to set in a more readable and reusable way. I worked it all out in a section of my slowly growing notes on the project. You can take a look [here](https://supermanzer.github.io/DendronNotes/notes/c874cfd9-6e98-431b-a86a-b60d0cbf3a69.html). In this note I'm describing how I want to control the `status` field of a particular copy of a book.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/queryset-annotations","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1678741318770},"$loki":4},{"slug":"traefik-subdomains","description":"How I learned to stop worrying and love my router","title":"Using Traefik with Docker-Compose","tech":"Traefik","img":"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v1.7/img/traefik.logo.png","published_to_twitter":false,"author":{"name":"Ryan Manzer","bio":"He puts the Manzer in Supermanzer","image":"/images/supermanzer.jpeg"},"tags":["tech","docker","traefik"],"toc":[{"id":"traefik-routing-and-sub-domains","depth":3,"text":"Traefik Routing and Sub-Domains"},{"id":"dynamic-routing-configuration","depth":3,"text":"Dynamic Routing Configuration"},{"id":"sub-domain-routing---all-time-favorite-feature","depth":3,"text":"Sub-domain Routing - All Time Favorite Feature"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"traefik-routing-and-sub-domains"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#traefik-routing-and-sub-domains","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Traefik Routing and Sub-Domains"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"image-asset","props":{"image":"traefik-architecture.png",":width":"700","className":["my-4"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"From what I can tell, people like the reverse proxy and load balancer "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://traefik.io/traefik/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Traefik"}]},{"type":"text","value":" for plenty of reasons.

This includes the concept of using one specific Docker network just to link all the web-server containers in each application stack to the Traefik router. This means each DB container, server (Python, PHP, etc.) container, and any other nifty stuff can live in a local network just for the containers specified in each `docker-compose` file.

Add REST APIs to the server-side, build out a front-end, and when I'm ready to make the swap I just change some labels in the `docker-compose` file and my users are routed to the new application design.\n\nOn the security side of things this has some advantages too. Let me first submit that I am in no way a security expert and there may still be flaws with the architecture I've proposed.

Their mission is to provide quality observations in the marine environment. They have data buoys around the world monitoring oceanic and coastal conditions (some lakes too). The data is readily accessible and freely available which, in my opinion, incredibly cool and exciting. Scientists of all stripes often have to spend time and effort funding, building, deploying, and recovering instrumentation to get some measure of the system they are interested in. That a large array of quality measurement platforms is just out there collecting data which is readily available to anyone was gobsmacking to me. For my regional buoy, NDBC has hourly measurements going back to 1985!\n\nThe issue I ran into was it was available in the form of `.txt` files (annual and monthly) or strange archive files I could not figure out how to open and parse. After creating my initial data set by downloading and stitching together monthly text files for two years, I figured there hard to be a better way. Later, in conversations with senior researchers in my field, I realized that even among the most seasoned professionals there really wasn't a common method used to readily access this data. I wanted to provide at least one potential option for people out there.\n\nThis project was initially written in `MATLAB` as part of my work on my [M.Sc. thesis project](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434318303601). Much of the current and planned functionality is based on the struggles I had wrangling my data. The shift from `MATLAB` to Python was born out of the one or two licensing scares near the end of my thesis and work on my publication. Additionally I had realized that using truely open and free software would make this package more accessible to students and researchers worldwide.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe NDBC Python Package, `pip install ndbc`, currently allows users so specify a single data station by the corresponding ID number during object instantiation. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom NDBC.NDBC import DataBuoy\n# Getting my regionial NDBC station\nn42 = DataBuoy(46042)\n```\n\nThe current features of the `DataBuoy` class are all based on moments in my research where my advisor asked me a question and I realized I should already have acess to the data.\n\n- `get_station_metadata()`: This function crawls a station's webpage and parses the info table often (but not always) present. Usually it will contain things like location (lat, lon), water depth, instrument position, etc.\n- `station_search()`: This feature is new to the Python implementation but it's based on being asked \"How do these observations correspond with nearby buoys?\". I wish I had thought of this earlier. It really just hits the NDBC website, parses the results, and returns a response. I created this functionality with the idea that a curious researcher shouldn't have to leave the terminal to do a simple search. It only returns a list of IDs but then you can instantiate more `DataBuoy` classes and start investigating what those stations have observed as well.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n### API Cleanup and the `@property` decorator\n\nThe core data structure is a dictionary. This allows the data storage to be quite flexible but I find myself making typos frequently when I have to traverse multiple layers of keys and values. One low hanging fruit in terms of package improvement would be the application of the `@property` decorator. This way I could retain the flexible nature of the dictionary for data storage while providing dot notation data access. This would also allow me to provide dot notation access without changing the underlying structure of the data which preserves backward compatability. For anyone not familiary with the `@property` decorator [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-property-decorator/) is a great breakdown of it's uses.\n\n### Data Checking Visualizations\n\nA somewhat more exciting, if longer term, feature would be some simple exploratory data visualizations being built into the class. I had one scare during my research in which I could not make sense of what I was seeing in my data until I made a line graph with the `datetime` value on both the x and y axes. Then it was clear that, rather than including the month of November, my data source had appended October twice. So a time plot might be nice. I would also like to provide a plot of all the paramters measured and their temporal coverage with valid data.\n","dir":"/projects","path":"/projects/ndbc-buoy","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1678741318817},"$loki":8},{"slug":"supermanzer","title":"This Website","summary":"I am building this site using new (to me) tools and frameworks.

I didn't want to have to create my own WYSIWYG editor locally and maintain all actions associated with that. Also I had just learned about the fantastic [Nuxt.js content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). This allows me to create everything from multi-page blog posts to simple one line comments from Markdown files. The module parses both the text content and the [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) into impressive data objects that mean I can use simple markdown files but provide enough details to\n\n1. Build a Table of Contents\n1. Load resources like external URLs or background images\n1. Provide the configuration data I use to dynamically build the interfaces.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nWorking on this site has taught me to solve many little problems and get more familiar with new-to-me aspects of front-end web development. Thankfully the good people a Nuxt.js have made some of this learning curve a bit less steep. Here's a quick list of some parts that have excited, confused, and frustrated me:\n\n- Vuex Store - The utility of a global store of data available in the application has been both a big shift and a significant headache. I was grateful to the Nuxt.js framework for setting it up by default and making it so easy to implement a module pattern. Coming from a Python background, I prefer namespaced functions to ensure a project can easily scale. However, understand how and when to invoke Mutations vs Actions and how I'm supposed to handle using State data in my Vue.js templates, specifically with v-model bindings has been challenging. I'm still slowly figuring it out and need to work on better data fetching methods to ensure my site runs smooth and fast. Thankfully there are a lot of smart people working on these exact issues who are happy to share their knowledge.\n\n- Vuetify.js - As I mentioned in the Technology Choices section, this has been very eye opening in terms of a visual framework that is both fairly simple and easy to get started with and provides a high degree of customization. I'm still just getting started but I think I will be building UIs with this quite a bit going forward.\n\n- Component life-cycles - Understanding when various components are rendered and re-rendered on such a dynamic interface has me still quite confused. I recognize this is part of power of these interfaces but sometimes I am left wondering \"where is my button?\" and I spend a good amount of time sifting through search results before I find out I'm assigning attributes before it exists.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nI am interested to see how far I can push the Markdown file based content system here. I plan to add a blog section to share my thoughts and I will also be interested to see how long it takes before I am reaching for an RDMBS data persistence layer to keep track of that stuff. Using Dendron for note taking has made me think the whole Markdown files as a data store approach is both flexible and sufficiently feature rich to let me go for a while. Additionally, while it does result in some re-typing of the same data, the ability to use front-matter in Nuxt content for searching and filtering means I can get some of the fun features of an RDBMS layer without the hassle. Although I do love designing and building database schema so that is likely going to happen eventually.\n","dir":"/projects","path":"/projects/supermanzer","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-13T21:00:42.927Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1678741318838},"$loki":9},{"slug":"todo-cla","title":"TODO Catalog CLA","summary":"A command line application that scans a code base and generates a TODO.md that logs all TOOO comments in project directory, written in Python","card_img":"/images/code-typing.jpeg","links":{"github":{"url":"https://github.com/supermanzer/todo-cla","icon":"mdi-github","text":"View on Github"}},"lead":{"name":"Ryan Manzer","bio":"He puts the Manzer in Supermanzer","image":"/images/supermanzer.jpeg"},"toc":[{"id":"problem","depth":2,"text":"Problem"},{"id":"solution","depth":2,"text":"Solution"},{"id":"goal","depth":2,"text":"Goal"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"problem"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#problem","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Problem"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I started programming because I thoguht it was fun to start telling the machines what to do, rather than the other way around.
