I am interested in constructing software and solutions for a variety of topics. I don't have direct experience in all the tech or business topics but I'm curious and would like to learn more. Much of the software I have worked on both professionally and academically have focused on automating tedious and repetitive tasks.
I have found that this type of automation can generally make people happier and more productive by removing or simplifying the least pleasant parts of their work. Many of my interests in further skill development are either focused on autommating boring stuff or allowing for more rapid insights.
