The importance of properly visualizing data in order to understand it was brought home to me while studying physical oceanography. Trying to stare at columns of numbers representing ocean temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll and get some insight into what is happening is near impossible. Once you turn it into a scatter plot of salinity by temperature and color the marks by chlorophyll concentration then the pattern of cold salty water being associated with high chlorophyll concentrations just jumps out at you!

That being said, it's a pet peeve of mine when I see things like linear regressions applied where the underlying data clearly violates the mathematical assumptions implicit in linear regressions. So I take a great deal of care to understand both the basic data I'm working with as well as what visualization techniques allow me to demonstrate the relationships I wish to investigate without introducing unnecessary bias. I'm really excited about how much attention this topic is receiving in terms of technology development.

I currently make use of Tableau (for work) and Tableau Public (for fun) as a means of testing out different visualization techniques. I've included a section on this site referencing some of my visuals that I particularly like. It's also good experience with the Tableau JavaScript API. However, my no-license, DIY, open-source mindset has caused me to dabble in D3 as well. Both approaches offer a wealth of options, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. As a fan of Python, I would like to find some reasons to integrate Python data visualization tools like Plotly, Seaborn, and Altair into a project but I haven't run into that situation yet.
