The topic of machine learning is so broad and can encompass anything from a hobbyist configuring a few hyper-parameters and providing a basic labeled data set to highly involved mathematical study of the most efficient methods for performing various calculations and transformations. I am definitely more in the hobbyist camp in terms of experience but I do find the mathematical underpinnings of ML quite interesting as well.

I completed Andrew Ng's[Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course via Coursera and, while I have completed other ML tutorials including on Coursera, I found Dr Ng's course to provide a greater fundamental understanding of how the components of machine learning algorithms actually work. ML is often described as a black box so it felt like getting to peak behind the curtain when I coded my own cost functions and gradient descent algorithms. I suspect there are many more applications to which ML and it's companion tech neural networks can be put than are currently being practiced.

For instance, I think it could be interesting to build labeled data sources and ML algorithms for nearshore coastal ecosystem events (like fish population levels, phytoplankton blooms, etc.). Natural scientists tend to prefer understanding the rules and mathematical relationships in their systems and then use this understanding to build predictive models. I think it might be useful, or at least point towards some topics that deserve more study.
