Since I got my start coding in the workplace in order to replace tracking data through spreadsheets, it should be no surprise I found myself creating databases and database applications.

I started in MS Access because

1. All our office computers already had it installed.
2. It played nice with Excel and Outlook.
3. My employer had a subscription to an education platform that included a series on building applications in MS Access.

Now I primarily use open source web tech like Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc. I find that using web frameworks simplifies the process of getting a user interface in front of my users and it provides a great deal of flexibility in how that UI looks/feels. From the start, I've enjoyed building the logic of the business into the business logic of my applications. In the program administration I built automated views of the records that needed the most immediate action.

In my current project of automating manufacturing schedules based on placed orders, it's allowing users to customize the rules that govern how orders get translated into manufacturing batches. Every time I take on a business project I find myself learning how to abstract more, hard-code less, and provide more intuitive interfaces. I'm surprised how much I like doing this stuff!
