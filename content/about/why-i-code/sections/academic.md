My academic coding started with building mathematical models of oceanographic processes, using the MATLAB programming language and IDE. From mutli-box models to define the flow of nutrients throughout the world oceans to 2D advection-diffusion models of the dispersal of pollutants into the surface water, I got to dig into some fun and nerdy topics.

For my M.Sc. thesis, I focused on physical mechanisms' influence on coastal phytoplankton by analyses of public data sources. I discuss one aspect of this in my NDBC Data Buoy Reader project. In addition to this I wrote many scripts for performing analyses and visualizing results. This is where I got my start in another passion of mine, data visualization. As my Physical Oceanography professor was fond of saying, if you don't visualize your data you don't understand it. While most of my academic coding was in MATLAB, all it takes is one licensing scare that threatens to derail years of work to make one realize that perhaps an open source alternative would be a better approach.

In addition to the buoy reader project I mentioned, I plan to go through some of the modeling approaches I learned using Python as a way to increase my understanding of both scientific Python programming and the modeling methods that led me down this crazy coding rabbit hole.
