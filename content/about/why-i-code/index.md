I got started coding, almost simultaneously, in two different contexts.

While working in a program administration office, I realized the inefficiencies of managing a large and complex program using spreadsheets on shared network storage and I resolved to find a better way. This lead me into the world of databases and data modeling.

Pursuing my M.Sc. of marine science, I took a course on mathematical modeling methods commonly used in oceanography. Here I got into data retrieval and computational analyses.

Both approaches lead to very different types of projects which are discussed in more detail on each tab. One thing is common though. Building things with code feels as much fun as using Legos when I was a kid. Except I never stepped on a stray Docker images on the way to the bathroom so I think coding wins.
