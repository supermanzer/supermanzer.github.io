I am interested in constructing software and solutions for a variety of topics. I don't have direct experience in all the tech or business topics but I'm curious and would like to learn more. Much of the software I have worked on both professionally and academically have focused on automating tedious and repetitive tasks.
I have found that this type of automation can generally make people happier and more productive by removing or simplifying the least pleasant parts of their work. Many of my interests in further skill development are either focused on autommating boring stuff or allowing for more rapid insights.

## Data Visualization

The importance of properly visualizing data in order to understand it was brought home to me while studying physical oceanography. Trying to stare at columns of numbers representing ocean temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll and get some insight into what is happening is near impossible. Once you turn it into a scatter plot of salinity by temperature and color the marks by chlorophyll concentration then the pattern of cold salty water being associated with high chlorophyll concentrations just jumps out at you!

That being said, it's a pet peeve of mine when I see things like linear regressions applied where the underlying data clearly violates the mathematical assumptions implicit in linear regressions. So I take a great deal of care to understand both the basic data I'm working with as well as what visualization techniques allow me to demonstrate the relationships I wish to investigate without introducing unnecessary bias. I'm really excited about how much attention this topic is receiving in terms of technology development.

In a previous job I made use of Tableau (for work) and Tableau Public (for fun) as a means of testing out different visualization techniques. I've included a section on this site referencing some of my visuals that I particularly like. It's also good experience with the Tableau JavaScript API. However, my no-license, DIY, open-source mindset has caused me to dabble in D3 as well. Both approaches offer a wealth of options, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. As a fan of Python, I would like to find some reasons to integrate Python data visualization tools like Plotly, Seaborn, and Altair into a project but I haven't run into that situation yet.

## Machine Learning

The topic of machine learning is so broad and can encompass anything from a hobbyist configuring a few hyper-parameters and providing a basic labeled data set to highly involved mathematical study of the most efficient methods for performing various calculations and transformations. I am definitely more in the hobbyist camp in terms of experience but I do find the mathematical underpinnings of ML quite interesting as well.

I completed Andrew Ng's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course via Coursera and, while I have completed other ML tutorials including on Coursera, I found Dr Ng's course to provide a greater fundamental understanding of how the components of machine learning algorithms actually work. ML is often described as a black box so it felt like getting to peak behind the curtain when I coded my own cost functions and gradient descent algorithms. I suspect there are many more applications to which ML and it's companion technology of neural networks can be put than are currently being practiced.

For instance, I think it could be interesting to build labeled data sources and ML algorithms for nearshore coastal ecosystem events (like fish population levels, phytoplankton blooms, etc.). Natural scientists tend to prefer understanding the rules and mathematical relationships in their systems and then use this understanding to build predictive models. I think it might be useful, or at least point towards some topics that deserve more study.

## Web Design

I have almost no real experience in web design but, as I build out a site I want to be both attractive and functional, I find myself drawn into this topic. I want to better understand how to develop a design palate, style my site so that it is relatively easy to make design changes that propagate through the site without a massive find/replace class string effort, and generally build a cohesive design pattern throughout the whole site while using styling to subtly indicate the type of content being viewed in different locations. I will have to find some good resources and do some learning.
