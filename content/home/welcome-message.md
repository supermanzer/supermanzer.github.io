### Welcome friends

This is my first serious attempt to build a personal site and I mostly use it to just have fun. I've spent most of my time in tech developing data systems, algorithms, and skimping on the visuals. For this site I'm engaging my artistic side a bit more and trying to craft something I find visually appealing. I'm also take the time to celebrate some things I get excited about and generally share my thoughts. This site is a fun project to work out more visually appealing designs. I look forward to implementing more fun and engaging visual and interactive elements while also tooting my own horn just a little bit.
